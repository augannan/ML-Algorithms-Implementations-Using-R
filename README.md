# ML-Algorithms-Implementations-Using-R
This repository presents implementations of several machine learning algorithms using R. 
Several mini projects using the machine learning algorithms in R will also presented. 
The ML algorithms discussed here are:
1. K-Nearest Neighbor
2. Logistic Regression
3. Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
4. Principal Component Analysis
5. Clustering Algorithms
6. Decision Trees
7. Support Vector Machines and Support Vector Regression
8. Polynomial Regression and Spline Analysis - Non-linear Modeling
9. Model Selection and Regularization Algorithms
10. Resampling Methods
